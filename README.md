# SAMRAI

SAMRAI (Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement Application Infrastructure) is an
object-oriented C++ software library that enables exploration of numerical,
algorithmic, parallel computing, and software issues associated with applying
structured adaptive mesh refinement (SAMR) technology in large-scale parallel
application development. SAMRAI provides software tools for developing SAMR
applications that involve coupled physics models, sophisticated numerical
solution methods, and which require high-performance parallel computing
hardware. SAMRAI enables integration of SAMR technology into existing codes and
simplifies the exploration of SAMR methods in new application domains. 

## Get Involved

SAMRAI is an open source project, and questions, discussion and contributions
are welcome!

### Mailing List

To get in touch with all the SAMRAI developers, please email samrai@llnl.gov

### Contributions

Contributing to SAMRAI should be easy! We are managing contributions through
pull requents here on GitHub. When you create your pull request, please make
`develop` the target branch.

Your PR must pass all of SAMRAI's unit tests, which are enforced using Travis
CI. For information on how to run these tests locally, please see our
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)

Our development process roughly follows the
[gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) model. The
`master` branch points to the last stable, tagged release. The `develop` branch
contains the latest changes. New features should be created in `feature/<name>`
branches and be based on `develop`.
